# Sumer

Here is a simulation program/game which ran on a minimal Digital Equipment PDP-8 system. The following description was taken from the 1973 DECUS Program Library Catalog.

Imagine that you are living in the city of Sumer, in the year 3000 BC. You are the king and each year you must decide how much of the city's store of grain will be given to the people as food, how much will be used for seed, and how much will be kept in storage.

At the beginning of each year your steward, Hamurabi, makes a report and asks for your decisions. The following information will assist you in formulating those decisions.

Each person needs 20 bushels of grain per year as food. If insufficient food is distributed, some people die of starvation. Half a bushel of grain is needed to plant one acre of land, and one person can plant and harvest 10 acres. The average harvest is 3 bushels per acre, but better or poorer harvest are common.

Land may be bought or sold. The price varies 'from year to year, but averages one acre for 20 bushels of grain.

Varying factors include the immigration of new people to the city (which is influenced by the city`s prosperity), the fact that rats occasionally eat a portion of the grain left in storage, and the occasional epidemic of plague.

The program was written using FOCAL, and ran on a 4K PDP-8. I've ported this to run on something more modern and portable, ie. an HP-48GX calculator. This was a favorite game of mine back in 1980, during my Fortran IV Programming class in High School. To play, we had to connect to a Community College computer using accoustical phone modems, and then run on one of the DECwriter printers or VT100 green screen terminals, normally used for entering and debugging programs.

A copy of the original FOCAL program (f0005.fc) and FOCAL Programming Manual are available if you want to port this over to another platform. I hope this brings back memories for any of you who played this in the past.
